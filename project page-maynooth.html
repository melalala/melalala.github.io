        <h2 class="col-xs">The Client</h2>  
	    <p class="text-grey col-xs"><b>Maynooth Furniture</b> is a new business selling affordable, high-end design furniture made in Ireland. Their primary objective is to build an e-commerce website and/or app for people to browse and purchase furniture for home delivery.
        </p>
		
        <h2 class="col-xs">The Concept</h2>  
	    <p class="text-grey col-xs">Maynooth produces both craftsman and line furniture. Regardless of their production method, at the heart of their business is making furniture that’s properly finished, has a long life and will retain its value.  They use top quality materials, like solid hardwoods and abiding techniques, like dovetail and tenon joints. <br><br>
They care about their pieces and the places they will occupy in each of their customers homes, that’s why they want to <mark-may>provide as much information as possible</mark-may> about their physical characteristics and care instructions, to <mark-may>help the customer</mark-may> envision the “fleshed-out” piece directly in their home, <mark-may>make an informed decision about their purchase</mark-may> and have the know-how to preserve it in good shape for a long time.<br><br>
As an extension of their interest in the piece’s well-being, they take the responsibility to provide the transportation, under a standard time table, but the customers can also choose a custom delivery time, at extra cost.</p>

        <h2 class="col-xs">The Competition</h2>  
	    <p class="text-grey col-xs">The competition in the furniture business is strong, with many local names and international ones as well, like: www.made.com, www.habitat.eu. <br><br>
Maynooth wants to place against its competitors with custom deliveries, <mark-may>thorough - but easily accessible - product descriptions</mark-may> and inspiration ideas that will <mark-may>help the customers make judicious decisions about their acquisitions</mark-may>.</p>		
	  
		<h2 class="col-xs">Target Audience</h2>
		<p class="text-grey col-xs">The store focuses on <mark-may>middle class people</mark-may> who appreciate durability, practicality and good taste. <br><br>
These are autonomous individuals, <mark-may>who enjoy a comfortable (but not extravagant) life-style</mark-may>, they usually own a house and they are both style and price conscientious and are careful to make educated purchases. <br><br>
They value proffessionalism, effort and responsibility and become loyal customers to brands that fit this description.

		<h2 class="col-xs">Organising the information</h2>
		<p class="text-grey col-xs">The first step in creating a structure for the new website was identifying the correct functional and content requirements. <br><br>
Being an e-commerce website, some of these requirements are implicit, like proper product categorisation, <mark-may>relevant product descriptions</mark-may> (with prices and pictures) and highlight deals and clearances. <br><br>
But the specificities of the furniture store also brings new requirements, like: <mark-may>proper classification of the broad product information</mark-may>, possibility to schedule the delivery, provide inspiration ideas and <mark-may>offer means of saving and revisit the design ideas</mark-may>.<p>
		
		<h3 class="col-xs">SKETCHES</h3>
        <p class="text-grey col-xs">I started the website’s layout by drawing the <mark-may>sketches of three</mark-may> of its <mark-may>pages</mark-may>: the home page, one of the category pages (the “Bedroom”) and a product page.<p>
		<img src="images/Maynooth - Sketch.png" alt="draw sketch notebook ux ui information architecture" width="1166" height="800" class="col-xs sitemap"/>
	    <h3 class="col-xs">WIREFRAMES</h3>
		<p class="text-grey col-xs">I used Adobe XD to create both the wireframes and the final mockup, afterwards. <br><br>There are <mark-may>slight changes in the wireframes, compared to the sketches</mark-may>, the most significant one being the <mark-may>reviews section</mark-may> of the product page. This section I identified it necessary in the meantime, by interviewing few of my close relatives that fit the persona description. <br><br>The reviews section sustains the user need of gaining even more insight about the product, based on subjective opinions and experiences shared by similar people.</p>

		  <div class="row-center">	
			<div class="col-md col-xs">
		        <h3 class="col-xs">HOME PAGE</h3>
				<p class="text-grey-left">The home page is structured in <mark-may>several sections that are in line with client requests</mark-may>. First hand, it shows a hero slider where the current store offers are announced on a background displaying beautiful pictures of furniture items. Then continues with the newly introduced products available on store. Next section is a shortcut for the main product categories. Then comes the clearances, and lastly, the inspiration ideas.<br><br>
Each of these sections have corresponding call-to-action buttons, offering guidance for visitors who are ready to purchase. <mark-may>The colours for each of the CTA buttons</mark-may> is not random, they <mark-may>were chosen based on the brand colours</mark-may> and they’re meant to support the sections they’re in. For example, the “new in store” section has the blue-green hues (#4CB3AA) representing “freshness”. The inspiration ideas has purple (#842C68), which evokes creativity and sophistication. The clearance and offers sections have fuchsia (#CC4C6E) and yellow (#F3B541), as they are both “alert” colours and induce a greater sense of urgency than the rest.

The filter & sort section is visually separated on the left side by a discreet gradient, consistent with the area markers used in the home page. 
Further search customisation is available through <mark-may>a series of sub-categories</mark-may>, meant to bring an even <mark-may>greater level of granularity</mark-may> to the search result sets. <br><br>
All of these refinements have the purpose of aiding the user in its search, help him to <mark-may>find faster a suitable product compatible</mark-may> with his needs. </p>

	          <h3 class="col-xs">PRODUCT PAGE</h3>
				<p class="text-grey-left">All the information about the product’s physical, qualitative and commercial characteristics is collected in this page. This information is available both through real-life images of the item and descriptive text. <br><br>
The pictures can be zoomed-in, added to favourites or pinned directly in the user’s Pinterest account, for later revisits. The product’s description comprises also a <mark-may>considerable amount of written details</mark-may>, as a succession of facets <mark-may>grouped in relevant categories (like dimensions, care instructions etc.)</mark-may>. <br><br>
The page continues with a section for similar products viewed by other users and ends with the <mark-may>product reviews section</mark-may>, where past buyers offer their subjective opinions about the selected product. To further support the need for relevant and compact information, this section allows a search through the review comments and offers a few search suggestions on the most significant topics. <br><br>
All of this is meant to <mark-may>inform the buyer in the best comprehensive way possible</mark-may>, before committing to a purchase.</p>

		  <h2 class="col-xs padd-top">The Progress</h2>
		  <p class="text-grey col-xs">The prototypes of both the website and the mobile app were completed in roughly 6 weeks. <br>This version of the product includes the feedback from other course participants and from the professor himself.
The <b>first feedback</b> was received for my wireframes, on the Skillshare platform. I got a helpful hint about the hero image section and a very <mark-may>encouraging thumbs up from the course creator and teacher</mark-may>:</p> 
			  <img src="images/Maynooth - comment.png" alt="skillshare user comment" width="50%" class="col-xs"/>
<p class="text-grey col-xs"><b>Second feedback</b> was received for an older versions of the website, that did not have the hero section groomed yet to look attractive.
</p>  
			<img src="images/Maynooth - Hero old.png" alt="ugly hero image furniture store" width="50%" class="col-xs zoomA"/>
<p class="text-grey col-xs">The constructive <mark-may>feedback was focused solely on the hero part</mark-may>, which led me to later reworks to upscale it into the version that exists now.<br><br>
On the <b>third</b> and final <b>feedback round</b>, the mobile app prototype received <mark-may>positive reviews</mark-may>, some of the most applauded parts mentioning its <mark-may>navigation, comprehensiveness and attention to details</mark-may>.
</p>
	
	 <h2 class="col-xs padd-top">Conclusion</h2>
		  <p class="text-grey col-xs"> Working on these prototypes, I learned more about how important the first impression is on a commercial website and for that matter, the hero section requires a greater design investment than I initially anticipated. <br><br>
The <b>prototype of the mobile app</b> can be accessed and commented <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/e0d60336-89e4-4de2-6c5e-647a9344b4b3-96e7/?fullscreen" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>
This is still a work in progress and my learning is nevertheless ongoing, therefore any feedback that can leverage my knowledge in design, is highly appreciated.
