		<p class="text-white"><span class="text-red">SUMMARY</span><br>This is the prototype of a potential mobile app for home security. The entire concept and design of the app is a project assignment, part of the CALART’s online course “UX Design Fundamentals”, on Coursera.</p>
	  </div>

 <main>
	  <div class="center-text container">
        <h2 class="col-xs">The Client</h2>  
	    <p class="text-grey col-xs"><b>Peekaboo</b> wants to join the home surveillance market as the most affordable, versatile and easy to use monitoring system.<br><br>
They want to build a mobile app that offers a more <mark-peek>casual alternative to traditional home security systems</mark-peek> and their key features are <mark-peek>simplicity, mobility, and affordability.</mark-peek>
</p>
		
        <h2 class="col-xs">The Concept</h2>  
	    <p class="text-grey col-xs">Have you ever been away from home, but wondered what your pet is up to? You can easily find this out with Peekaboo. <br><br>
<b>Peekaboo</b> is a paired mobile app that, on one hand, will enable your mobile device’s video camera to sense movement and on the other hand, allow you to see what is happening in its range, from a remote location. Its notification service works economically in your favour, <mark-peek>taking and sending you photos only when movement is sensed</mark-peek>. But you can also choose to <mark-peek>connect remotely</mark-peek> from the paired device, whenever you want, and watch a live stream video. <br><br>
It can be installed on any Android/ IOS / Windows Phone 10 (or higher) mobile device.<br><br>
<mark-peek>It is ideal for pet monitoring</mark-peek> but it also provides the most affordable home surveillance system.</p>

        <h2 class="col-xs">The Competition</h2>  
	    <p class="text-grey col-xs">There are apps and systems on the market that check some of the functionalities of Peekaboo, but not all of them at once. <br><br>
For example, <b>Skype</b> has an auto-answer option, so you can video call anytime from another mobile device and this way you create a remote connection and can see the live video stream through the camera of the monitoring device. But it <mark-peek>doesn’t have a motion detection notification system</mark-peek>. And you also require two different login accounts on each of the two devices.<br><br>
<b>TeamViewer</b> provides full remote control from another device, but the <mark-peek>pairing between the devices must be done each time with a different password</mark-peek>, automatically generated by the monitoring device. So unless this password is provided to the receiving device, the remote connection cannot be established. <br><br>
<b>Alfred Systems Inc</b> is the main competitor. This app has almost all of the functionalities provided by Peekaboo: motion detection notification system with photos, remote connection, management of received photos and notifications, an easy pairing mechanism, using only the user’s Gmail address which is entered on both devices during setup. However, this exact simplicity <mark-peek>prevents it from allowing multiple devices to be paired</mark-peek> to the monitoring one. <br>Peekaboo addresses this limitation and makes it possible, in an easy way, to pair multiple devices at the same time. This way, all of the devices will be notified at once when motion is sensed. </p>		
	  
		<h2 class="col-xs">Target Audience</h2>
		<p class="text-grey col-xs">The idea comes mainly in support of the <mark-peek>people who have pets and travel</mark-peek> but want to check in on them and be assured that they are ok. <br><br>

Other categories of people could find different benefits from using the app as well:<br>
- Cautious people that are <mark-peek>on a budget</mark-peek> will find the app to be an economical surveillance system, from a financial perspective;<br>
- Because the app works only when there’s movement, this will make it attractive to <mark-peek>environmental conscientious</mark-peek> people who want to have a surveillance system that is economical from an energy-saving perspective;<br>
- The app can also come to the aid of <mark-peek>practical people, with small children</mark-peek> as they can monitor them from a different room of the house.

A typical home surveillance system does not fit their needs entirely. Cats can stay for a long time hidden in different parts of the house and only pass by every so often. It’s a slight chance that at those exact moments, they are connected remotely to see him in range.</p>

		<h2 class="col-xs">Organising the information</h2>
		<p class="text-grey col-xs">In order to articulate and structure the goals of the app, I first identified the correct functional requirements, that respond directly to the user and client needs. <br><br>
The app has to work interchangeably as a <mark-peek>monitoring tool</mark-peek> and as a <mark-peek>remote access point.</mark-peek><br><br>
As a <b>monitoring tool</b>:<br>
- The app provides a setup through which the user creates the <mark-peek>connections between the current device and the ones that will later receive the notifications</mark-peek>. This is made possible based on a uniquely generated key that is shared with each paired device. <br>
- The app will then make use of the mobile device’s camera to <mark-peek>take photos whenever it senses movement and send them as push notifications</mark-peek> to the paired devices. <br>
- The setup will also allow the user to <mark-peek>choose the frequency of the notifications</mark-peek>, the camera sensitivity or whether to use the flashlight or not.<br><br>

As a <b>remote access point</b>:<br>
-  the user can establish a <mark-peek>remote connection</mark-peek> from the paired device towards the monitoring device, at any time. <br>
- It saves and provides a <mark-peek>medium for managing the photos</mark-peek>.<p>
		
		<h3 class="col-xs">SITEMAP</h3>
        <p class="text-grey col-xs">While developing the logic of the app, I also worked on the look and feel of it.<p>
		<img src="images/Peekaboo_site_map.png" alt="" width="1166" height="800" class="col-xs sitemap"/>
	    <h3 class="col-xs">WIREFRAMES</h3>
		<p class="text-grey col-xs">For the first step into the visual grounds of the product, I used Balsamiq tool to create the wireframes and lay out the structure and hierarchy of the information I had outlined in previous steps. <br><br>
The wireframes (or the visual answer to “what goes where and why?”) of the monitoring tool is shown below.</p>

				<p class="text-grey-left">The splash screen is a <mark-peek>short animation where the product introduces itself by presenting its logo and tagline in a ludic way</mark-peek>. This sets the tone for its lighthearted ease of use.<br><br>
At the end of the animation, there’s a call for action which lets you know that a <mark-peek>setup procedure</mark-peek> is in order next. But rest assured, this is accomplished through a common effort of both yourself, as the user, and the product, which will guide you properly along the way.</p>

		  <h2>The Progress</h2>
		  <p class="text-grey">The concept and design of the app were completed in 1 month. The final version of the product includes the feedback of <mark-peek>three unmoderated user test sessions</mark-peek>, held on the Coursera platform. After each unmoderated test session, I received feedback from 3 users. <br><br>
The <b>first session</b> revealed that the terminology used for <mark-peek>labelling was considered either too abstract</mark-peek> or <mark-peek>too technical</mark-peek>l. The initial labels can be seen in the wireframes, and words like “sender”, “receiver” or "devices" were not appealing to the users, some even considering them confusing. This set me up to find more practical and graspable terms for the technical setup of the app.   
<br><br>   
After the <b>second test session</b>, improvements were made also on the UI part. The users pointed out that some of the <mark-peek>colours were too desaturated</mark-peek> and that the appearance transgressed into muddy. Therefore, I chose brighter, but still warm colours that are not too striking.</p>
		<div class="row-center clear-padd-up">
			<div class="col-md col-xs">	
			   <h4 class="col-xs">Then</h4>
			   <img src="images/Peekaboo - then.png" alt="" width="540" height="460" class="mobile-img"/> 
			</div>
			<div class="col-md col-xs"> 
			   <h4 class="col-xs">Now</h4>
			   <img src="images/Peekaboo - now.png" alt="" width="540" height="460" class="mobile-img"/> 
			</div>
		</div>
	    <p class="text-grey">The <b>third</b> and final <b>test session</b> confirmed that the changes brought noticeable improvements. Positive feedback was received on the app’s <mark-peek>intuitiveness and ease of use</mark-peek>. And after the adjustment of the colour palette, the current look and feel was appreciated as <mark-peek>“cute and cosy”</mark-peek>.</p>
		
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p class="text-grey">Working on this prototype, I learned more about the importance of labelling as part of the information architecture. Any chosen name should correctly embody the information it represents.<br>On the other hand, the choice of colours as part of the UI, should back up the visual harmony of the interface.<br><br>
The <b>prototype of the mobile app</b> can be accessed and commented <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/1f30d094-44c3-4615-4d64-f80f73fd4340-6901/?fullscreen" target="_blank">here</a>. <br><br>
This is still a work in progress and my learning is nevertheless ongoing, therefore any feedback that can leverage my knowledge in design, is highly appreciated.</p>
