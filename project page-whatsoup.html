		<p class="text-white"><span class="text-red">SUMMARY</span><br><br>
		  This is the prototype of an e-commerce website for a potential restaurant in Bucharest, Romania.
The entire concept and design of the restaurant’s website is a project assignment, part of the CALART’s “Web Design” online course, on Coursera.</p>
	  </div>

        <h2 class="col-xs">The Client</h2>  
	    <p class="text-grey col-xs">What’SOUP is a new restaurant in Bucharest, Romania selling moderately priced, traditional soups.  
		    Their goal is to have an <mark>e-commerce website</mark> for people to order soups for home delivery, which highlights the company’s <mark>stand out features: order customization and organic ingredients.</mark></p>
		
        <h2 class="col-xs">The Concept</h2>  
	    <p class="text-grey col-xs">The idea was born in a corporate kitchen, on a day when a bunch of colleagues were debating, at lunch break, about why they cannot find anywhere the <mark>exact kind of home-cooked meals they were used to eating while growing up.</mark><br><br>  
The Romanian soup (ciorba) is a token for healthy and delicious eating. And while the existing range of traditional restaurants selling food online is fully satisfactory in Bucharest,  with some very well appreciated ones, like www.lamama.ro or www.laplacinte.ro, <mark>the problem</mark> these people were facing <mark>was not the lack of a delicious traditional meal, but the existence of that same traditional meal richened by the particularities that come with each family recipe.</mark> 
One single ingredient, or the lack of it, can alter a well-known taste and make it something different. Even if it’s still good, it’s not the same. And when you crave for your grandma’s garlic tomato soup, anything different will simply not do!<br><br>
For this reason, no doubt, the best solution is to start cooking. But what if you could <mark>choose your own ingredients</mark> and <mark>provide cooking instructions online</mark>, and someone else would cook it and then bring it to your door?<br>
This is the  distinguishing characteristic of What’SOUP. An ingenious new concept for order customization, where <mark>the buyer can customize its own soup to the level of ingredients</mark>. And not only that but also the use of <mark>organic ingredients, supplied only by local farmers</mark>, to ensure the rich, all-round delicious taste of home-cooked soups.</p>
		
		<h2 class="col-xs">Target Audience</h2>
		<p class="text-grey col-xs">The restaurant focuses on <mark>career-oriented people who appreciate home-cooked meals</mark>, are nostalgic over their childhood family recipes, but do not have the necessary time to spend cooking them.<br><br> 
These are ambitious, dynamic, hands-on problem-solvers who value freethinking, honesty and sustainability.  Their liable nature also makes them <mark>conscientious about their choices of consumption</mark>, especially about what they eat and drink. However, their proneness to juggle many tasks at once makes it hard for them to maintain a work-life balance, where every decision of this kind requires designated time to become well informed.  <p>

		<h2 class="col-xs">Organising the information</h2>
		<p class="text-grey col-xs">The first step in creating a structure for the new website was identifying the correct <mark>functional and content requirements</mark> that respond to the user and client needs. 
Being an e-commerce website, some of these requirements are implicitly mandatory, like relevant product descriptions (with prices and pictures), suggestions for top-selling soups, being able to create an account and log in, finding out easily if the restaurant delivers to a certain address, and last but not least, a process for ordering and checkout. 
But <mark>the specificities of the restaurant also brings new requirements</mark>, like guidelines on how the user can create his own soup, a process for soup customization: finding and selecting different ingredients, as well as the possibility to save the customization for future orders.<p>

				<p class="text-grey-left col-xs">The second option presents the process of order customization  by, first, offering the <mark>possibility to choose the ingredients</mark> you want to have in your soup, in each category: meat, vegetables, extras, toppings.
				<br><br>
				I chose to have all the ingredients on the same page, to <mark>mimic the actual cooking process</mark> where, in preparation, you lay all of your ingredients on the table.

				<p class="text-grey-left">The categories exist only as a mean of finding the ingredients faster, but <mark>the transition between one category to another is seamless and fluid</mark>.

The resemblance to the cooking activity extends also to the <mark>“My SOUP” window</mark>. This one <mark>acts like the “bowl”</mark> where you throw all of your ingredients and see your soup getting made.

<mark>Saving your soup to favourites</mark> brings the advantage of ordering it faster the next time you want it, without going again through the entire customization process.

				<p class="text-grey-left col-xs">The logo is inspired by <mark>traditional needlepoint patterns</mark>. I chose this design to communicate the authenticity that springs from the Romanian folklore. The typeface Luminari, which is used for the first word (“what”) was chosen due to its <mark>resemblance with the archaic handwritten letters</mark> of the Romanian language, while the Optima typeface brings a welcoming transition into modernism. This typeface was also chosen for its wide, full-bodied characters, to smoothly <mark>incorporate the little bowl of soup icon</mark> inside the word “SOUP”.

				The <mark>“menu” action buttons are green</mark>, as opposed to the rest of the “infrastructure” buttons which are either black or white.<br><br>
				The “tick” of every checkbox, as well as the address confirmation, was designed as a <mark>playful grass thread</mark> that is in line with the natural theme of the restaurant.

			  <h2 class="col-xs padd-top">The Progress</h2>
		  <p class="text-grey col-xs">The prototype of the website was completed in roughly 4 weeks. <br>This version of the product includes the feedback of <b>three unmoderated user test sessions</b>, held on the Coursera platform. After each unmoderated test session, I received feedback from 3 users. <br><br>
<b>The first session</b> brought to my attention a <mark>confusing aspect of the main navigation</mark>. Initially, in order to stress the importance of entering a delivery address before doing anything else, I chose a design that was inhibiting the access to the menu navigation page until the user entered a valid delivery address. Only after this action, the menu tab would become available.</p> 
			  <img src="images/what'SOUP-addr-menu.png" alt="sitemap" width="666" height="200" class="col-xs zoomA"/>
<p class="text-grey col-xs">As said, this aspect was appreciated as confusing rather than helpful, which led me to adjust the main navigation menu to the one that exists now. <br><br>The <b>second test session</b> pointed out the <mark>aversion of the users towards the Luminari typeface</mark>, which back then was used both for the main navigation labels (as can be seen above) and also the page titles. Consequently, I decided to remove the typeface altogether and replace it with Optima. The brand logo is the only place where it is still preserved.<br>At this point, changes were also made to the “Log in” button, which was switched to an icon to preserve consistency with the cart icon.<br><br>
On the <b>third</b> and final <b>test session</b>, the product received <mark>all-round positive feedback</mark>, some of the most applauded parts being related to the <mark>visual hierarchy, branding, and layering</mark>.
</p>
	
	 <h2 class="col-xs padd-top">Conclusion</h2>
		  <p class="text-grey col-xs">Working on this prototype, I learned more about the necessity and importance of a clear and intuitive navigation on a website, as well as the aesthetic nuances that can be created with the typeface alone.<br><br>
The <b>prototype of the website</b> can be accessed and commented <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/8e4bc867-6cf1-49a1-6c94-645c1f6ce132-f87a/" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>
This is still a work in progress and my learning is nevertheless ongoing, therefore any feedback that can leverage my knowledge in design, is highly appreciated.
