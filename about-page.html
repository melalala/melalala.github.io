        <h2 class="col-xs">The Past</h2>  
	    <p class="text-grey col-xs">For 12 years I worked in Bucharest, Romania as an Oracle Database developer in several multinational companies. Even if this was the official position I held, along the years my profession demanded that I wore many hats. This is how I got to fill the roles of full stack developer, tester, customer support specialist, requirements analyst and product owner. <br><br>
This multitude of professional experiences (which in the latter part of my career I handled all simultaneously) brought me a very deep, atomic knowledge of the product I was working on, but concurrently, it also painted a holistic picture of it.  This naturally propelled me into becoming the “go-to” person for each of our users and clients, globally distributed in more than 20 European and Asian countries. <br><br>
Throughout the time I was gathering, refining and developing requests from the clients, I was also training, consulting and supporting the users. I’ve found myself more engaged and fulfilled by the latter, drawn to understanding both the drives and constraints of  the people interacting directly with the product and building trust with them. And the product owner role put me in the very agreeable position of prioritizing the new requests to the users' advantages. </p>

	<h2 class="col-xs">The Present</h2>  
	    <p class="text-grey col-xs">Later, I’ve found there’s an actual job for this: User Experience Designer.  However, I didn’t get the chance to dwell officially into this position, as I relocated to Switzerland in July 2019.<br><br>
Ever since, I’m studying to grow my knowledge and skills in different areas of this multidisciplinary profession. I’ve taken several online courses on content strategy, prototyping, interaction and visual web design, out of which this portfolio content emerged. <br><br>
I also wanted to upscale my front end development competences on responsive web design, so I worked on building this website, from scratch.<br><br>   
Right now, I’m finishing yet another UX design online course and feel confident to search for real-life projects.</p>

	<h2 class="col-xs">The Future</h2>  
	    <p class="text-grey col-xs">My wish is to obtain an internship position in a company where I can bring my <a href="CV.pdf">transferrable skills and past work experience</a>, but where I will also have the opportunity to grow new ones as a UX designer. <br><br>
I am a fast, dedicated learner, especially when it comes to things I’m passionate about.<br><br>
Do you think you can help me in my endeavour?</p>
